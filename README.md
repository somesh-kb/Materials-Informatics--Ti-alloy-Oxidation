# Materials-Informatics-Ti-alloy-Oxidation

This project is very special to me as this was my first End-2-End project. The core objective is to develop a ML model which can predict the "Oxidation rate constant" (corrosion rate) of Ti alloys which is critical to determine their life span. This is critical to aerospace industries as the Ti alloys are critical component of jet engines. This model may help to ascertain when different components of jet engines will require replacement in order to prevent any engine failure.
